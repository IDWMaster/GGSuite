* TESTING: Run tests on VLANs with same subnet
* Create API to receive a callback when a new DNS entry is added to the system
* Finish serialization/deserialization logic for the IP protocol driver
* RunQuery (GGDNS.cpp) should be re-structured to make it more readable.
* Timeouts don't seem to be working properly (GGDNS). This needs fixing.
