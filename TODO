* InternetProtocol.h has crashes after updating to new address notation -- probably not related. Should investigate why it crashes.
* TESTING: Run tests on VLANs with same subnet
* Create API to receive a callback when a new DNS entry is added to the system
* Finish serialization/deserialization logic for the IP protocol driver
* RunQuery (GGDNS.cpp) should be re-structured to make it more readable.
* Timeouts don't seem to be working properly (GGDNS). This needs fixing.
* Make a way for a ProtocolDriver to specify its MTU
* Make a JumboFrame driver that is capable of sending very large packets over a ProtocolDriver which doesn't support it
